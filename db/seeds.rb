The aim of Meinsweeper is to locate a number of coals that are hidden on the grid, and mark their location with a chimney brush. Increasing the difficulty level increases the size of the grid and the number of coals hidden.'

   description:'In 1952, Christopher Strachey wrote a programme for Mark One "Baby", the computer housed at Manchester University. This programme provided a database of verbs and nouns from which "Baby" would construct love poems. My version sends its user a simplistic love sentence, many of which are inspired by Shakespearean sonnets:

The forward violet thus did I chide : Sweet thief lift the very urn of my yearning
The end.
Love,
Computer.'
